## Go’s Hangman Game

Build a simple version of a ‘hangman’ game as a server-side application.

Some of the application logic should live in the client, the candidate should design the system
in a manner so that the client and server have differing responsibilities.

## Requirements

1. As a user I want to be able to start a new game;
2. As a user I want to be able to guess a character for an ongoing game;
3. As a user I want to be notified when the game I am playing ends (win/game over);
4. As a user I want to resume an incomplete game;
5. As a user I want to be able to list all the games that have been played so far and the ones that are currently ongoing;
6. As a user I want to be notified when I trigger an action which results in a server failure.
